# VimOrganizer
VimOrganizer is partly a clone of Emacs' Org-mode, and partly a front end to Org-mode itself.  Do Org in Vim.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++THIS PROJECT IS ABANDENED++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sorry, it is definitely abandoned. You should be able to get all the
info you need by reading the info.txt and install.txt files, and
there's way more information in the vimorg.txt plugin help file you'll
find in the doc folder.

I myself now use Org-mode in Emacs using Evil, which is an excellent
Vim clone within Emacs. Not quite Vim, but feels close enough and
Emacs has its advantages.

Cheers,

Herbert
